# Landing Page Project

This project is based on HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, but it mainly focuses on implementations of DOM manipulations and some other features like the **Intersection Observer** API, which provides an easy way to watch and register callbacks to trigger when elements on a page come into view.

### Introduction

This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. It will prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM and show you how JavaScript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

### Instructions

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page with a dynamically updating navigation menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

### The DOM

The properties and methods that I've used in this project for manipulating the content and HTML elements to make the project dynamic are:

- .getElementById()
- .querySelector()
- .querySelectorAll()
- .createElement()
- .appendChild()
- .addEventListener() -> click event
- .innerHTML property
- .classList property -> .remove() & .add()
- .className property

### ES6

Some of the ECMAScript 6 features that I have used in my project are:

- Let and Const
- Template Literals
- For...of Loop
